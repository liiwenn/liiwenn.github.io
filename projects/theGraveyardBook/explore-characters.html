          <div class="char-text bod-right whitebox">
            <p>Bod is the most Goth kid you'll ever meet - he lives
            in a graveyard and is raised by ghosts, a vampire, and a werewolf, for Pete's sake. He has Freedom of the Graveyard, which means he can communicate with the dead, move through walls, and is invisible to most humans (so long as he's in the graveyard).</p>

            <p>For most of the story, readers know more about Bod than he knows himself. We are there when Bod's parents and sister are killed, but Bod doesn't even know he's an orphan until he's about ten years old. Knowing what Bod doesn't know makes his life seem sadder. As with the graveyard folks, this knowledge makes us feel very protective toward Bod.</p>

            <p>Even though we get to see many sides of Bod, his character is always mysterious. Think of it like this: Bod has to remain hidden from most of the living, and most of his companions are ghosts or supernatural creatures. Plus, Bod, because he hasn't had enough interaction with living people, hasn't had a chance to develop his character in the same way that other kids his age do. We think that a lot of his character is still in development &ndash; it will only reveal itself (to readers and to Bod) when Bod begins to live his life outside the graveyard.</p>

            <p>Even though Bod lives in a graveyard and is raised by ghosts, he's a student, just like a normal kid. Does that mean he's learning about spelling, long division, and the parts of a plant cell? Well, not exactly. Bod learns stuff like reading, writing, geography, and everything else in Mr. Pennyworth's Compleat Education System for Younger Gentlemen with Additional Material for Those Post-Mortem. But his most important lessons are about other things.</p>

            <p>Like other fantasy book heroes, Bod has to learn the skills he needs to survive in his world. Harry Potter learns Defense Against the Dark Arts, Potions, and Transfiguration. Percy Jackson learns Greek mythology, sword fighting, and how to kill monsters. Tom Ward learns how to bind boggarts and catch witches with a silver chain.</p>

            <a href="#"><p class="clickhere">(Click here for the full list of skills)</p></a>

            <p>Bod becomes especially interested in his education when he finds out that his family was murdered by an evil man, and that man wants Bod dead too. When Silas tell him this, Bod instantly wants revenge, and Bod's approach to revenge is to learn as much as he can. When Mrs. Owens tells him "there's nothing [he] can do" (7.31), Bod disagrees:</p>
            <p>"I can learn everything I need to know, all I can. I learned about ghoul-gates. I learned to Dreamwalk. Miss Lupescu taught me how to watch the stars. Silas taught me silence. I can Haunt. I can Fade. I know every inch of this graveyard." (7.31)</p>
            <p>When we get to Chapter 7, we see all of Bod's lessons coming together. When Bod fights the Jacks, everything he has learned prepares him for that moment. We get the sense that fighting the Jacks is just one (major) episode with many more heroic episodes to come. And his training has served him well.</p>

        <h1>silas</h1>

        <div class="characterbox characterbox-reverse">
          <div class="char-text silas-left whitebox">
            <p>Silas is Bod's guardian. He takes care of all of Bod's basic needs, like food and shelter. He's also Bod's idol &ndash; the guy Bod looks up to, and will always look up to above all others. Silas isn't dead, but he isn't alive either. He's a sad, lonely figure, not fitting in with either the living or the dead, like when he is can't join in the Danse Macabre (where the dead and the living dance, for one night only). He is full of wisdom, but also full of pain. He's also a big mystery.</p>

            <p>It's not clear exactly why Silas lives in the graveyard where Bod is raised. At the end of the novel, when Bod leaves the graveyard, Silas leaves too. It's almost as if Silas was waiting there just for Bod. We're never exactly sure how much Silas knows about the Jacks and the prophecy of their destruction before he meets Bod, or how much he learns from investigating. We're never sure if Silas would have agreed to be the guardian for just any infant that popped up in the graveyard, or whether he was especially aware of his role in fulfilling an ancient prophecy, one involving Bod in particular.

        <h1>miss lupescu</h1>
        <div class="characterbox">
          <div class="lupe-left char-img">
            <img class="imgborder" src="img/lupe.png" alt="lupe">

          <div class="char-text lupe-right whitebox">
            <p>We first meet Miss Lupescu when Silas has to leave the graveyard for a while. She's the person Silas found to be Bod's guardian while he's away. At first she seems like the worst kind of substitute teacher. She gives Bod lessons, but they're all super boring. She's extremely strict and demands that he pay attention. And she makes Bod eat nasty food. She's the kind of substitute teacher who might cancel your class pizza party because you fell asleep during her snooze-worthy class, and then feed you beetroot-barley-stew-soup because pizza isn't healthy.</p>

            <p>Even though she seems like the substitute teacher from Hell, she turns out to be a werewolf who saves Bod from Hell. That's right, when the ghouls drag Bod into Hell, it's Miss Lupescu who rescues him.
            </p>

            <p>Miss Lupescu and Bod don't start out the best of friends. Why? Because of her bossy ways and her icky food. Make that seriously icky food: "dumplings swimming in lard; thick reddish purple soup with a lump of sour cream in it; cold boiled potatoes; cold garlic-heavy sausages [...]" (3.68). That's a big change from the food Silas gets for Bod, which "mostly came in packets, purchased from the kind of places that sold food at night and asked no questions" (3.38).
            </p>

            <p>However Miss Lupescu isn't only feeding Bod's body with home-cooked, high-nutrition (well, except for the lard) food, she's also teaching him all the discipline and practical knowledge he's lacking. She tells him about all the kinds of "people" in the world, including ghouls and Hounds of God. She also teaches him "ways to call for help in every language in the world" (3.68).
            </p>

            <p>Teaching Bod to cry for help in Night-Gaunt (the language of the night-gaunts, of course) soon helps him escape Hell and the ghouls. But teaching him to call for help in every language of the world will help him wherever he goes, not just Hell. And if he knows how to call for help, he'll also recognize when someone else calls for it too. Since he seems meant for a life of heroism, this is a good thing all around.</p>
            </p>

            <p>Once Bod realizes that Miss Lupescu's lessons actually are useful in his life, he becomes an enthusiastic student, drinking up all the knowledge she puts before him. Bod and Miss Lupescu seem to become friends, and she even takes him to a football game.

        <h1>mr & mrs owens</h1>

          <div class="char-text owens-left whitebox">
            <p>Mr. and Mrs. Owens are agreed to be Bod's graveyard parents when he wandered into the graveyard. Including the time they've been in the graveyard, they've been married 250 years. Their one regret is that they never had kids. Good thing Bod wandered into the graveyard so they could become parents. They seem to be very nice people and pretty good parents, but they aren't involved in any of Bod's adventures.</p>
